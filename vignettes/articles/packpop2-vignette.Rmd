## Install the package

As a fundamental step, there is a need to install population package if you want to use this data set.

Here is a chunk in order to install the package:

```{r setup, message=FALSE, force = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
if(!require(remotes)){
    install.packages("remotes")
    library(remotes)
}
remotes::install_github("NiloofarNL/packpop2")
```

Also a summary of this package can be seen by the chunk below:

```{r}
library(packpop2)
summary(Population2016)

```

Following this, there is a list of libraries in this data set:

```{r setup2}
library(packpop2)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)

```

As mentioned before, this data set has 14 variables

Also we can see the bar chart of population in each block

```{r}
ggplot(data = Population2016, aes(x = OBJECTID, y = Population)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
