This data provides information about population of Mashhad metropolice based on families,owners, tenants, and so on in each block in 2016. There a number of different targets that can be reached through this package such as population density This dataset contains 11 variables and 19943 rows.

## Install the package

As a fundamental step, there is a need to install population package if you want to use this data set.

Here is a chunk in order to install the package:

```{r setup, message=FALSE, force = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
if(!require(remotes)){
    install.packages("remotes")
    library(remotes)
}
remotes::install_github("NiloofarNL/packpop2")
```

Also a summary of this package can be seen by the chunk below:

```{r}
library(packpop2)
summary(Population2016)

```

Following this, there is a list of libraries in this data set:

```{r setup2}
library(packpop2)
library(ggplot2)

```

As mentioned before, this data set has 14 variables

|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| Cottages or Sheds       | Number of sheds in a block                             |
| Shape_Length            | Surrounding a block in meter scale                     |
| Shape_Area              | Surface area of a block in meter scale                 |
| Area(Hectare)           | Surface area of a neighbourhoods in hectare scale      |
| PopulationDensity      | Population density of each neighbourhood               |
| Population              | Whole population of each neighbourhood                 |

Also we can see the bar chart of population in each block

```{r}
ggplot(data = Population2016, aes(x = OBJECTID, y = Population)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Population density in Mashhad 2016",fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("MashhadDensity.png")
```

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mashhad's Neighbourhoods in 2016",fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("MashhadNeighbours.png")
```
